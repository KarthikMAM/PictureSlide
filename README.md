# PictureSlide
A photo frame widget for windows desktop

It is a picture slide widget inspired by VAIO's Music by Sony album art transition. It uses four frames(one which is hidden and used as a buffer). The pictures are stored in a circularly linked dequeue to optimize access.

This can be controlled by Gesture from a handheld device, using the Gesture recognition library which I developed for the <b>32 HOUR STARTUP</b> held in my College
